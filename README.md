## 👋 About Me

Hi! I’m <strong>Meghana Bhange</strong> — a researcher and engineer working at the intersection of <strong>machine learning, privacy, and social impact</strong>.

My current research investigates <strong>Algorithmic Collective Action</strong> as a lens for designing socio-technical systems that empower communities — not just individuals — to resist harm and reclaim agency. 🌍🤖 I pursue this direction as a PhD researcher at the <a href="https://tisl-lab.github.io/" target="_blank">Trustworthy Information Systems Lab (TISL)</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/meghana-bhange" target="_blank">Mila – Quebec AI Institute</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://aivodji.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ulrich Aïvodji</a>.

I completed my Master’s in Information Technology Engineering at ÉTS Montréal in 2025. My thesis focused on building <strong>privacy-preserving infrastructure for collective complaint systems</strong>, co-supervised by <a href="https://aivodji.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Ulrich Aïvodji</a> and <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca/programmes-et-formations/corps-enseignant/jmrobert" target="_blank">Prof. Jean-Marc Robert</a>.

Previously, I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer and also currently do freelance consultancy at <a href="https://www.toptal.com/resume/meghana-bhange" target="_blank">Toptal</a> in my free time, where I’ve contributed to AI and NLP-driven projects like building inclusive hiring pipelines (using SpaCy, GPT-3, FastAPI) and an automated trading platform integrating technical indicator based strategies that can trade live with platforms such as Interactive Brokers. I enjoy collaborating with clients from different domains as it helps me sharpen my practical problem-solving.

#### 🌱 Small Open Source Contributions

So far, I've made a few minor open source contributions — but one of my goals for 2025 is to get more involved and contribute more meaningfully to projects I admire.
